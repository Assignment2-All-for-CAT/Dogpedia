2. Use browser cookies or the web storage API to customize the experience for returning visitors. The website should recognize and greet returning visitors.
3. Make sure any form data is validated and formatted for return to the back-end. To demonstrate you will send the data to another page rendering and simulate responding.  - **Subscribe Newsletter Part**
4. Dynamic interactive content that modifies the user experience in some way, e.g. dark mode.
5. Include the use of asynchronous data from a publicly accessible API. - **Breeds Page**
6. You are free to use any simple libraries (like jQuery) that can be implemented through online linking or simple file inclusion. - **I think jQuery saves a lot of time by not having to type "document.queryselector" everytime so maybe we could use that.**
