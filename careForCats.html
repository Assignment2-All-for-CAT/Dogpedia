      <h1>Care For Dogs</h1>
      <p>
        As pet owners, we all want the best for our furry family members. It is
        important to every pet parent that their fur friends are getting
        everything they need to be happy and healthy pets. Taking care of a pet
        is more than just making sure their bowl is full or that the dog is
        walked and the litter box is scooped.

        <h2>Dog Owner’s Responsibilities</h2>
        <p id="ownerDes">
          Get ready for a lifetime of companionship, long walks and occasional
          dog treats! A dog can be a great addition to your home and family.
          Follow these pointers and you and your pet will enjoy a lifetime of
          love and companionship together:

            <b>SPAY OR NEUTER</b>
            <p>
              Sterilization prevents unwanted litters and reduces the risk of
              reproductive cancer, false pregnancies and roaming.
            </p>
            <b>LICENSE AND MICROCHIP</b>
            <p>An identification tag should be worn at all times.</p>
            <b>HAVE A VETERINARIAN EXAMINE YOUR DOG ANNUALLY</b>
            <p>
              Keep your dog’s vaccinations up to date. Proper veterinary care
              will help ensure a longer and healthier life for your dog.
            </p>
            <b>PROVIDE ADEQUATE EXERCISE</b>
            <p>
              Dogs that don’t get enough exercise tend to be overweight, bored
              and at greater risk of experiencing health problems. They can also
              develop behavioural problems. Dogs should be exercised a minimum
              of twice daily.
            </p>
            <b>SUPPLY QUALITY FOOD, WATER AND SHELTER</b>
            <p>
              Neglect in these areas makes for an unhealthy, unhappy dog and
              ultimately, a shortened lifespan.

              A well-trained dog will not be a nuisance to you, your family, or
              your community.
            </p>
            <b>CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR DOG</b>
            <p>
              Excrement left in parks or on sidewalks is not only unsightly, but
              can transmit disease and parasites.

            <b>MY DOG IS TOO ENERGETIC. WHAT CAN I DO?</b>
            <p>
              Your dog may be bored, lonely or simply not getting enough
              exercise. Puppies and adolescent dogs under three years of age
              require more exercise than grown dogs. Some dogs, particularly the
              herding and sporting breeds, need to be busy to be happy. If your
              dog seems to have excess energy, follow the suggestions in What
              can I do if my dog is bored?

            <p>
              Interactive play time is an important part of an indoor cat’s
              life. Interactive play builds confidence, relieves stress and
              frustration, and allows for bonding time with kitty’s favourite
              person: you.
            </p>
            <b>HOW CAN I STOP MY DOG FROM BARKING SO MUCH?</b>
            <p>
              Excessive barking can be an annoyance for your neighbours as well
              as your family. Until the problem is resolved, keep your dog
              indoors when you’re out of the house, and let your neighbours know
              you’re working on a solution. Dogs bark for all kinds of reasons.
              Here are a few tips that could help:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensure that your dog is getting adequate exercise.</li>
              <li>
                Teach a “quiet” command by allowing one or two barks, then
                saying “quiet” while shaking a can of coins to distract your
                dog. While your dog is quiet, offer praise and a treat, a toy or
                other positive reward.
              </li>
              <li>
                If your dog barks at perceived intruders, such as the mail
                carrier, desensitize your dog by having someone walk by the
                yard. Offer treats and praise as quiet behaviour continues and
                the person comes closer.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="resBox">
          <img src="./Images/cat-desktop3.jpg" alt="cat image" id="img3" />
          <div class="harnessContent">
            <b>Practice training in different situations</b>
            <p>At the dog park, around noise, children, etc.</p>
            <b>Exercise your dog!</b>
            <p>
              Dogs need the socialization and mental stimulation of lengthy
              daily walks for their emotional and physical health.
            </p>
            <b>Spend time appropriately</b>
            <p>
              Spend your dog’s active time training her appropriately rather
              than being frustrated when she uses that energy to tear up sofa
              cushions.
            </p>
            <b>Distract the dog</b>
            <p>
              If your dog is doing something you don’t like, distract him and
              take the time to teach him something else, such as sitting instead
              of jumping up to greet.
            </p>
            <b>Don't punish!</b>
            <p>
              Always remember! It is completely ineffective to punish or reward
              your dog after the fact. Dogs respond to immediate gratification —
              not delayed punishments or rewards.
