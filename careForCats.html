      <h1>Care For Cats</h1>
      <p>
        Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a
        cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a
        very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t
        want too much human interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there is no guaranteed way to choose the perfect cat for you and
        your lifestyle, understanding your expectations as well as what makes
        cats tick will help you to bring home a cat that should be able to cope
        with its new environment and be the pet that you want too.

        <h2>Cat Owner’s Responsibilities</h2>
        <p id="ownerDes">
          Cats are a delightful addition to a home and family.They are now the
          #1 pet in North America. Follow these pointers and you and your pet
          will enjoy a lifetime of love and companionship together:
        </p>

          <div class="resContent">
            <b>SPAY OR NEUTER</b>
            <p>
              Spaying or neutering will prolong the life of your cat and help
              reduce the risk of reproductive cancer in your pet. Male cats are
              less likely to spray when neutered early (seven to nine months).
              Female cats should generally be spayed by the age of six months.
            </p>
            <b>LICENSE AND MICROCHIP</b>
            <p>
              The municipal animal shelter receives thousands of stray cats
              arrive every year, and only nine per cent are claimed by their
              owners.
            </p>
            <b>KEEP YOUR CAT INDOORS</b>
            <p>
              The safest place for your cat is indoors, but she can enjoy the
              outdoors while supervised on a leash and harness or in the safety
              of a catio.
            </p>
            <b>HAVE A VETERINARIAN EXAMINE YOUR CAT ANNUALLY</b>
            <p>
              Keep vaccinations up to date to ensure your cat is disease- and
              parasite-free.
            </p>
            <b>SUPPLY PROPER NUTRITION</b>
            <p>
              Ensure your cat has quality food and water. A well-nourished and
              healthy cat will live a longer life with fewer trips to the
              veterinarian.
            </p>
            <b>ADDRESS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS</b>
            <p>
              Inconsistent use of the litter box is a common problem cat owners
              often face, but one that can often be corrected. Contact your
              veterinarian for advice and guidance.
            </p>
            <b>PROVIDE PROPER GROOMING</b>
            <p>
              Owners should not ignore the importance of daily or weekly
              grooming. Grooming provides an opportunity to detect fleas or
              other problems that might otherwise go unnoticed.

            <b>HOW TO MAKE LIFE INDOORS ATTRACTIVE TO YOUR KITTY</b>
            <p>
              Whether your cat is already a strictly indoor cat or a newly
              transitioned one, you will want to ensure your home has all the
              items your cat requires to keep her feeling safe and mentally
              stimulated. This includes:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                A refuge room where your cat can go to feel safe during times of
                anxiety (loud noises, unfamiliar visitors, construction, etc.);
              </li>
              <li>
                Places to climb and perch, such as a cat tree or a window perch;
              </li>
              <li>An appropriate scratch post;</li>
              <li>
                Solo toys that can keep kitty entertained on her own, such as
                toy mice, ping pong balls and even paper bags;
              </li>
              <li>
                A litter box that is kept well cleaned, as cats have meticulous
                litter box preferences;and,
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactive toys, such as cat wands, that can be used by you
                during play time with your pet.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <b>GETTING THE MOST FROM INTERACTIVE PLAY TIME</b>
            <p>
              Interactive play time is an important part of an indoor cat’s
              life. Interactive play builds confidence, relieves stress and
              frustration, and allows for bonding time with kitty’s favourite
              person: you.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select an interactive toy that really appeals to your cat and
                stimulates their prey drive, such as a cat wand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once you have found the perfect toy, move it in a manner that
                triggers your cat’s prey drive;
              </li>
              <li>
                depending on the toy, this may be moving through the air or on
                the ground, or alternating between high and low. Quiver the toy,
                have it peek out from behind couch — have as much fun with it as
                your cat is!
              </li>
              <li>
                Always allow kitty to pounce on the toy and catch it
                occasionally.
              </li>
              <li>
                When play time is almost over, begin to wind down your movements
                so your cat doesn’t stay in a state of high-arousal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactive play should be done with your cat two to three times
                daily.
              </li>
            </ol>

          <div class="harnessContent">
            <p>
              Be very patient and persistent and reward your pet lovingly.
              Yelling, hitting or rough treatment will only teach your cat to
              fear you and will accomplish nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Begin training at six or seven months of age. Have the cat spayed
              or neutered first, as this enhances their concentration and
              decreases their desire to roam.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purchase a light-weight H-shaped nylon harness that buckles at the
              neck and the stomach. It should also have a metal ring on the back
              portion for proper I.D. and to attach to a light-weight leash.
              Collars, figure eight harnesses with breastplates allow the cat to
              slip out too easily. To find the correct size, measure the cat’s
              neck and stomach snugly, but not tightly. Purchase an I.D. tag at
              the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Place the harness with the I.D. tag and leash where the cat can
              sniff, paw and play with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After several days, gently, but firmly, put the harness on the cat
              and allow for two-finger widths at the neck and at the stomach –
              do not attach the leash yet. Leave the harness on for five minutes
              initially. Repeat this several times a day for one to two weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the cat is comfortable with the harness, attach the I.D. tag
              and leash. Let the cat drag the leash around the house for several
              minutes at a time, for a few days. Be sure to supervise the cat to
              avoid her becoming tangled in furniture. When the cat has accepted
              this part, pick up the leash and hold on to it. The cat will
              realize she has restraints. Pull on the leash gently, offer food
              and say the word “come”. Be patient.
